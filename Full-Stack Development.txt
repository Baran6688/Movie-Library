Full-Stack Development Project: Movies Library  Application

Objective:
Develop a full-stack web application using Node.js and SQL for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. Additionally, create a mobile application using Flutter.

Project Overview:
Build a 'Movie Library' application that allows users to browse, search, add, update, and delete detailed movie information. The application should have both a web-based interface and a mobile application with consistent functionality.

Requirements:

Backend:
Use Node.js for backend development.
Employ a SQL database (such as SQLite) to store movie data.
Design RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on movie data.

Movie Data Attributes:
Each movie entry should include the following details:
Movie: Title, Description, Release Year, Genre, Director(s)
Cast: List of actors, including their name, age, and country of origin.
Likes: A count of how many users have liked the movie.
Comments: User-generated comments about the movie.
Ensure the database schema accommodates these details efficiently.

Frontend (Web):
Implement the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Enable interaction with backend services using AJAX or Fetch API.
Features should include viewing movie details, adding new movies, editing existing movies, deleting movies, liking movies, and viewing/adding comments.

Mobile Application (Flutter):
Develop a Flutter-based mobile application with similar capabilities as the web interface.
